To do (Feb. 12, 2013)
- RSA Encryption
    * Clean up bit length of e, currently just set at 8 bits
    * Add exceptions for bad key lengths for general key generation, maybe just
         allow arguments to specify different levels (eg: 1 = 512, 2 = 1024)
    * Should abstract key class be in this package, or in some higher folder?
         Other classes have keys, should they all extend the same class?

- OTP (One time pad)
    * Is this the best common encryption scheme for pgp?
    * Must implement

- PGP (Pretty good privacy)
    * Must pull together OTP and RSA
    * Has to generate random, one time use key

- General
    * How to interact between two computers (possibly front end), and how to
        get a recipients public key
    * What functions should be available to users?
    * Add documentation for all methods and classes <-- IMPORTANT
    * How will keys and messages be exchanged? (Front end)
    * Work out git commit structure
